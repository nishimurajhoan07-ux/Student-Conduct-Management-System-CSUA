If a minor offense is repeated, the system suggests the next level of disciplinary action to ensure consistency and fairness across all cases.'],

             'a' => 'Yes. All students have a "Request Appeal" button on their portal which initiates a formal review by the OSDW. You will be notified of the appeal status and can submit supporting documentation throughout the process. Appeals are reviewed within 5 business days.'],

Regular security audits are conducted, and all database access is logged and monitored to ensure institutional privacy standards.'],
            ['q' => 'How long are conduct records kept?',
             'a' => 'Conduct records are maintained throughout your enrollment at CSU and for 5 years after graduation, as per university policy. Minor violations may be expunged after a clean conduct period, as defined in the Student Handbook. Contact OSDW for specific retention questions.'],
